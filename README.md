### Description
This is a remake of the dinosaur game from Google. It was my first time working with Unity, but I thought it would be a great way to showcase my C# skills. Everything, except for the ground and the background, was created by my girlfriend and me.

This was my first real experience using Unity, and I was inspired to make a 2D endless platformer game. Ultimately, I decided I wanted it to be like the dinosaur game.
I had alot of fun creating this and learned alot about Unity.
